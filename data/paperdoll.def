# This file maps a body id to a paperdoll gump id
# <body-id> <paperdoll-gump-id> <offset for this body> <fallback offset>
# offset is usually either 50000 for male bodies, 60000 for female bodies. The fallback offset
# is used if there is no gump at the primary offset (i.e. if there is no special female gump and
# the male one should be used)
