    In case you want to redesign this gump, keep in mind that at this point, you can not
    access any uo data (i.e. art.mul graphics), as the mul files are not loaded yet.
    
    All action="selectshard" buttons that are not used (due to having less shard folders than
    buttons) are set insivible.
